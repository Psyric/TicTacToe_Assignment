This is my TicTacToe Assignment that does the following:

-Runs ESP as a game console and you use the game by using the interface on a single terminal.

-TEXT USER INTERFACE, TUI

-It has three modes:

-Mode 1: Player vs AI (bash)

-Mode 2: Player 1 (X) vs Player 2 (O)

-Mode 3: AI (C) vs AI (bash), in which it runs 100 games

-Shows result on LCD

Instructions:

To play this game, update broker ip on the files to your instance or ip, then compile the game file to your ESP and connect your pins to the correct pins, as shown in Freenova Chaper 20 tutorial.

To run this on your terminal, type this command on your terminal "./tictactoe_tui" and it will load up the game and select a mode.

Note: when exiting the program or mode, please reload/reboot your esp32.

Please give me a good amount of credit because I spent everyday after the project to get this working...
